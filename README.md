# R. Kaan Karaman — Personal Website

This is the source for my personal website and technical blog. It’s a small, static site built with React and Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS, and deployed on a custom domain. The blog content is written in Markdown, and there's an RSS feed generated from frontmatter.

I use this space to publish cross-posts from my Medium articles, share projects I've worked on, and collect foundational reading material I often return to—papers, tools, and books that have influenced how I think about systems and machine learning.

There’s no tracking or analytics. Just static content, served cleanly.
